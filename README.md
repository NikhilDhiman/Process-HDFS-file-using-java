# Process-HDFS-file-using-java
In this project I am reading a file (basically a csv format file) which is stored on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) using Java. After reading the file from HDFS we are going to process the same file like we will be doing some operations as calculating median of numeric column and mode of string columns. 
After successfully processing the file I am going to store the aggregated results to the MySQL table.
I have runing this java program using Spark on hadoop cluster.
